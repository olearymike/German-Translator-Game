# Take a CSV file with multiple categories: German Word, English Equivalent, and PoS

# A game that gives you an English word and asks for the German equivalent, kinda like Quizlet
# Also like Quizlet, it keeps track of which words you aren't as familiar with

# Uses Panda and Plotly to show your learning statistics (What PoS you need most help with)

# There will be another mode where you are given an English sentence and you must translate it
# The sentences will be randomly generated. It will start off using simple phrases like "Die blau Katze l√§uft"
