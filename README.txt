This is a little program that helps you put your foreign language skills, specifically German, to the test!

I'm currently a freshman at the University of Massachusetts Amherst majoring in both Computer Science
and German & Scandinavian Studies, and I wanted to create something that helps me combine both of my majors in a fun way.

So far the terminal will give you an English word and ask for the German translation. That's all so far!
