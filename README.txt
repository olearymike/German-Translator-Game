This is a little program that helps you put your foreign language skills, specifically German, to the test!

I'm currently a freshman at the University of Massachusetts Amherst majoring in both Computer Science
and German & Scandinavian Studies, and I wanted to create something that helps me combine both of my majors in a fun way.

How To Play: 
1. When you start the program, you're able to choose which part of speech you'd like to study (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or all). 
If nouns are selected, you'll be able to choose a category of nouns to go over.

2. Then terminal will give you an English word and ask for the German translation. 

3. If you get it right, you'll be presented with another word until you input 'Q' to quit the program.

4. If you get the word wrong more than once, then the word will be given to you while giving you another attempt.
